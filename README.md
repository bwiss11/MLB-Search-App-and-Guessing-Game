# MLB Search Application

## Introduction
This application allows a user to search for an MLB player by name and year. It utilizes the public MLB API for statistics and ESPN's public API for player images.

## Searching for a Player
On the main search page, the user can search for a player by typing in their first and last name in their respective boxes, and selecting the year (the current year is the default). Once the user clicks the 'Search' button, the page will display the player's statistics for the season that was searched for, along with their number, name, team, position, and headshot. See the results below for searching for Adley Rutschman's 2023 statistics.

## Generating a Random Player
In the "Random" tab, the user can generate random players and will be shown their statistics from the current year. The user may generate as many random players as they like. In the screenshot below, Rafael Devers has been generated as the random player, and his 2023 statistics are displayed.

## Guessing Game
The 'Guessing Game' page allows the user to generate a random player's statistics by clicking the 'Initiate Player' button. This will generate a player who has played in 2023, and will show the statistics from each year of their career. The goal for the user is to guess the player based on the shown statistics. If the user gets stuck, they can click the 'Hint' button and will be shown the player's current team. Once the user thinks they know the player or gives up, they can click the 'Reveal Player' button to reveal the answer.
